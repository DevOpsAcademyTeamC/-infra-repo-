# -infra-repo-
//tmp name for **infra-repo**// for project realized during DevOps Academy Course by TietoEvry

TODO: choose repo name and project

**Ways of working** (WIP potencjalnie do końca tygodnia):
1. Working in Scrum:
    * rotating roles of PO and SM
    * one week long sprints
    * daily meeting to discuss what is to be done today
    * at the end of each sprint sprint review with Paweł

2. CI/CD:
    * using principles of CI/CD to automate process of code integration and deploying them to finished product
    * automation of tests run as a part of CI to ensure code quality and detect issues early
    * using deployment pipelines in Jenkins to automate CD part

4. Iterative Development:
    * dividing work into small "bite size" tasks
    * adding new software/features at the end of each sprint 
    * commits should contain single feature to easily track what (and where) went wrong
    * we work on different branches (NOT ON MAIN) and we merge them with main when we are sure all works correctly

5. Tools and Technologies:
    * Jira: Kanban board, product backlog managment system
    * Git/Github: SVN, space to manage code and facilitate collaboration
    * Discord and Messanger: communication between team members
    * Jenkins: pipelines, environment for implementing CI/CD principles
    * Docker: containerisation
